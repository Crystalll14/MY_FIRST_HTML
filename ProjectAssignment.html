    <h1><u>My Favorite Meal Recipe</u></h1>
    <h3><u>Name of Food</u></h3>
    <p>The recipe for today is my favorite meal: YAM & EGG</p>
    <img src="./images/download (1).jpeg" alt="Food">

    <h3><u>Origin</u></h3>
    <p>Yams originated in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Africans call yams “nyami,” which is
        where we get the word “yam.” They are cylindrical and vary in size. Some of the largest
        yams have weighed more than 100 pounds and have been several feet long. Yams have a
        dense white, purple, or red flesh and scaly brown skin with dark spots. A yam is starchy
        and dry. In African culture, it is typically boiled or roasted. They have a shelf-life of six
        months, but you will have a hard time finding a true yam on a shelf in an American grocery
        store.
        Yams and sweet potatoes are often grouped together. Sweet potato and yam are not
        interchangeable terms. They have very little in common, other than both being tuber root
        vegetables. The confusion does not end in America! In Japan the “purple yam” is a
        mislabeled sweet potato. In Malaysia and Singapore, taro is called “yam,” and in New
        Zealand the oca tuber is called a “yam.” The sweet potato comes from the morning glory
        family, while the yam is related to the lily. Yams lack the orange coloring that sweet
        potatoes have, therefore, they are not a good source of beta-carotene. Yams do supply
        carbohydrates and fiber, two important nutrients for feeling full and having energy. </p>
    <p>People have been eating eggs for a very long time— about six
        million years! The first people to eat eggs took them from nests in
        the wild and ate the eggs raw. There is no way to know who ate
        the first egg. What researchers do know is people living in Egypt
        and China were the first to keep hens. It is also believed that when
        Columbus returned to the New World in 1493, he had chickens on
        board. Historians suspect the chickens that lay the eggs we eat
        today are descendants of the chickens Columbus had on board.</p>
